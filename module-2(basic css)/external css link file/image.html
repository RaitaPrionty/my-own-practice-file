    <p>The Developers
        It has already been mentioned that every well-written paragraph should have a middle consisting of a number of
        supporting sentences. These supporting sentences which expand and develop the main idea (introduced in the topic
        sentence) of the paragraph are generally known as the developers. They present evidence or examples in support of
        the main idea.
        We know that a paragraph is a unified and coherent piece of writing. The function of the developers is to bring
        about this unity and coherence. They give unity to the paragraph by dealing with the same subject and their logical
        arrangement brings the necessary coherence. The number of developers in a paragraph is not fixed. You can write as many of them as you think necessary for a complete development of the topic. But you must remember that all your developers should contribute to the development of the same idea. In other words, all of them should be about the same subject and they should also be logically linked with one another to give the paragraph unity and coherence.
